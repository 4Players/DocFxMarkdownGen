# DocFxMarkdownGen

Generates documentation for a .NET library in Markdown intended for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) using [docfx](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).

## Usage

`config.yaml`:

```yaml
outputPath: /home/jan/whatever/docs/api
yamlPath: /home/jan/gen/api
```

* `outputPath` is the path where the generated documentation will be placed, it is always wiped.
* `yamlPath` is the path where the `.yml` files generated by docfx are placed, probably the `api` directory where you `docfx.json` file is.
