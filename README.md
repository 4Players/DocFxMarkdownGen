# DocFxMarkdownGen

Generates documentation for a .NET library in Markdown intended for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) using [docfx](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).

## Usage

`config.yaml`:

```yaml
outputPath: /home/jan/whatever/docs/api
yamlPath: /home/jan/gen/api
```

- `outputPath` is the path where the generated documentation will be placed, it is always wiped.
- `yamlPath` is the path where the `.yml` files generated by `docfx metadata` are placed, probably the `api` directory where your `docfx.json` file is.

## Example sites

- [`examples/discord-net-dfmg`](https://discord-net-dfmg.jan0660.dev/api): example site done on [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)
- [Log73](https://latest-log73.jan0660.dev/api)

This project is still very new, if you find an issue in the markdown generated, please open an issue!
