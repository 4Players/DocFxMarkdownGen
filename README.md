# DocFxMarkdownGen

Generates documentation for a .NET library in Markdown intended for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
using [docfx](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).

## Installation

```sh
dotnet tool install -g DocFxMarkdownGen
# now installed as "dfmg", use with "dotnet dfmg" or just "dfmg" if tools are in PATH
```

## Usage

By default dfmg takes it's config from `config.yaml`, you can override the file using the `DFMG_CONFIG` environment
variable.

```yaml
outputPath: /home/jan/whatever/docs/api
yamlPath: /home/jan/gen/api
```

- `outputPath` is the path where the generated documentation will be placed, it is always wiped. Can be overriden with
  the `DFMG_OUTPUT_PATH` environment variable.
- `yamlPath` is the path where the `.yml` files generated by `docfx metadata` are placed, probably the `api` directory
  where your `docfx.json` file is. Can be overriden with the `DFMG_YAML_PATH` environment variable.
- `indexSlug` is the slug of the index page, defaults to `/api`.
- `typesGrouping` read below.

### Types grouping

Example:

```yaml
# ...
typesGrouping:
  enabled: true
  minCount: 1 # default is 12
```

If type grouping is enabled, types in namespaces with a number of types greater than or equal to `minCount` will be
grouped by `Class`, `Struct`, `Interface`, `Enum` and `Delegate` in the sidebar.

### Newlines

Example:

```yaml
# ...
#brNewline: "  \n" # default is "\n\n"
#forceNewline: true # default is false
#forcedNewline: "  \n" # default is "  \n"
```

- `brNewline` is the string that will be used to replace `<br/>` tags in the generated markdown.
- `forceNewline` if true, will replace all newlines(`\n`) with `forcedNewline`.
